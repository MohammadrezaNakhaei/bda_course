The observations for the 2008 algae status at each site are presented in the dataset algae in the aaltobda package (‘0’: no algae, ‘1’: algae present).\nLet \\(\\pi\\) be the probability of a monitoring site having detectable blue-green algae levels and \\(y\\) the observations in algae. Use a binomial model for the observations \\(y\\) and a \\(\\BetaDist(2,10)\\) prior for binomial model parameter \\(\\pi\\) to formulate a Bayesian model. Here it is not necessary to derive the posterior distribution for \\(\\pi\\) as it has already been done in the book and it suffices to refer to that derivation. Also, it is not necessary to write out the distributions; it is sufficient to use label-parameter format, e.g. \\(\\BetaDist(\\alpha,\\beta)\\).\nYour task is to perform Bayesian inference for a binomial model and answer questions based on it:\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSubtask 2.a)\n\n\n\n\n\nFormulate\n\nthe likelihood \\(p(y|\\pi)\\) as a function of \\(\\pi\\),\nthe prior \\(p(\\pi)\\), and\nthe resulting posterior \\(p(\\pi|y)\\).\n\nReport the posterior in the format \\(\\BetaDist(\\alpha,\\beta)\\), where you replace \\(\\alpha\\) and \\(\\beta\\) with the correct numerical values.\n\n\n\n\n\nHint:\nWith a conjugate prior, a closed-form posterior has Beta form (see equations in the book and in the slides).\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSubtask 2.b)\n\n\n\n\n\nWhat can you say about the value of the unknown \\(\\pi\\) according to the observations and your prior knowledge? Summarize your results with a point estimate (i.e. \\(E(\\pi|y)\\)) and a 90% posterior interval.\n\n\n\n\n\nHint:\nPosterior intervals are also called credible intervals and are different from confidence intervals.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSubtask 2.c)\n\n\n\n\n\nWhat is the probability that the proportion of monitoring sites with detectable algae levels \\(\\pi\\) is smaller than \\(\\pi_0=0.2\\) that is known from historical records?\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSubtask 2.d)\n\n\n\n\n\nWhat assumptions are required in order to use this kind of a model with this type of data?\n\n\n\n\n\nHint:\nNo need to discuss exchangeability yet, as it is discussed in more detail in BDA Chapter 5 and Lecture 7.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSubtask 2.e)\n\n\n\n\n\nMake prior sensitivity analysis by testing a couple of different reasonable priors and plot the different posteriors.

Points should be given if the method is right, even if the result is wrong because the posterior was wrong in the first place. If the posterior was right, the 90% posterior interval is roughly ….\nQ8: \nFor the c) part, is the posterior probability Pr(π&lt;0.2|y) reported?

Part of the course is practicing making data analysis reports. By providing feedback on the report presentation and other students can learn what they can improve or what they already did well.

For now, you should solve the assignment without the tools showcased herein.\nThe posterior package’s random variable datatype rvar is a “sample-based representation of random variables” which makes handling of random samples such as the ones contained in the above variables p0 and p1 easier. By default, it prints as the mean and standard deviation of the samples, such that rvar(p0) prints as 0.05 ± 0.021 and rvar(p1) prints as 0.1 ± 0.029.\nThe datatype is “designed to […] be able to be used inside data.frame()s and tibble()s, and to be used with distribution visualizations in the ggdist package.” The code below sets up an R data.frame() with the samples in p0 and p1 wrapped in an rvar, and uses that data frame to visualize the samples using ggdist, an R package building on ggplot2 and “designed for both frequentist and Bayesian uncertainty visualization”.\nThe below plot, Figure 3 uses ggdist’s stat_dotsinterval(), which by default visualizes\n\nan rvar’s median and central 66% and 95% intervals using a black dot and lines of varying thicknesses as when using ggdist’s stat_pointinterval() and\nan rvar’s samples using grey dots as when using ggdist’s stat_dots():\n\n\nr0 = rvar(p0)\nr1 = rvar(p1)\nggplot(data.frame(\n    rv_name=c(\"control\", \"treatment\"), rv=c(r0, r1)\n)) +\n    aes(xdist=rv, y=rv_name) + \n    labs(x=\"probabilities of death\", y=\"patient group\") + \n    stat_dotsinterval()\n\n\n\n\nFigure 3: Probabilities of death for the two patient groups.\n\n\n\n\nrvars make it easy to compute functions of random variables, such as\n\ndifferences, e.g. \\(p_0 - p_1\\): r0 - r1 computes an rvar which prints as -0.05 ± 0.037, indicating the sample mean and the sample standard deviation of the difference of the probabilities of death,\nproducts, e.g. \\(p_0 \\, p_1\\): r0 * r1 computes an rvar which prints as 0.005 ± 0.0026 which in this case has no great interpretation, or\nthe odds ratios needed in task 3.b).\n\nBelow, in Figure 4, we compute the odds ratios using the rvars and visualize its median, central intervals and samples, as above in Figure 3:\n\nrodds_ratio = (r1/(1-r1))/(r0/(1-r0))\nggplot(data.frame(\n    rv=c(rodds_ratio)\n)) +\n    aes(xdist=rv) + \n    labs(x=\"odds ratio\", y=\"relative amount of samples\") + \n    stat_dotsinterval()\n\n\n\n\nFigure 4: Odds ratios of the two patient groups.\n\n\n\n\nYou can use Figure 4 to visually check whether the answers you computed for 3.b) make sense.\nThis block showcases advanced tools, which you will be allowed and expected to use after this assignment.

    "text": "1 General information\nThe exercises of this assignment are not necessarily related to Chapter 1, but rather work to test whether or not you have sufficient knowledge to participate in the course. The first question checks that you remember basic terms of probability calculus. The second exercise checks your basic computer skills and guides you to learn some R functions. In the last three ones you will first write the math for solving the problems (you can, for example, write the equations in markdown or scan and include hand written answers), and then implement the final equations in R (and then you can use markmyassignment to check your results).\nThe maximum amount of points from this assignment is 3.\nWe prepared a quarto template to help you get started.\n\n\nReading instructions:\nChapter 1 in BDA3, see the reading instructions.\nGrading instructions:\nThe grading will be done in peergrade.\nAll grading questions and evaluations for this assignment are contained within this document in the collapsible Rubric blocks.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFurther information\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe recommended tool in this course is R (with the IDE R-Studio). You can download R here and R-Studio here. There are tons of tutorials, videos and introductions to R and R-Studio online. You can find some initial hints from RStudio Education pages.\nInstead of installing R and RStudio on you own computer, see how to use R and RStudio remotely.\nWhen working with R, we recommend writing the report using quarto and the soon to be provided template. The remplate includes the formatting instructions and how to include code and figures.\nInstead of quarto, you can use other software to make the PDF report, but the the same instructions for formatting should be used..\nReport all results in a single, anonymous *.pdf -file and return it to peergrade.io.\nThe course has its own R package aaltobda with data and functionality to simplify coding. To install the package just run the following (upgrade=\"never\" skips question about updating other packages):\n\ninstall.packages(\"remotes\")\nremotes::install_github(\"avehtari/BDA_course_Aalto\", subdir = \"rpackage\", upgrade=\"never\")\n\nMany of the exercises can be checked automatically using the R package\nmarkmyassignment. Information on how to install and use the package can be found here. There is no need to include markmyassignment results in the report.\nRecommended additional self study exercises for each chapter in BDA3 are listed in the course web page.\nCommon questions and answers regarding installation and technical problems can be found in Frequently Asked Questions (FAQ).\nDeadlines for all assignments can be found on the course web page and in peergrade. You can set email alerts for trhe deadlines in peergrade settings.\nYou are allowed to discuss assignments with your friends, but it is not allowed to copy solutions directly from other students or from internet. You can copy, e.g., plotting code from the course demos, but really try to solve the actual assignment problems with your own code and explanations. Do not share your answers publicly. Do not copy answers from the internet or from previous years. We compare the answers to the answers from previous years and to the answers from other students this year. All suspected plagiarism will be reported and investigated. See more about the Aalto University Code of Academic Integrity and Handling Violations Thereof.\nDo not submit empty PDFs or almost empty PDFs as these are just harming the other students as they can’t do peergrading for the empty or almost empty submissions. Violations of this rule will be reported and investigated in the same way was plagiarism.\nIf you have any suggestions or improvements to the course material, please post in the course chat feedback channel, create an issue, or submit a pull request to the public repository!\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nRubric S1: General information - 7.5/100 points\n\n\n\n\n\n\nQ1: \nCan you open the PDF and it’s not blank?\n\nQ2: \nIs the report anonymous?\n\n\n\n\n\n\n2 Basic probability theory notation and terms\nThis can be trivial or you may need to refresh your memory on these concepts (see, e.g. Aalto course First Course in Probability and Statistics). Explain each of the following terms with one sentence:\n\nprobability\nprobability mass (function)\nprobability density (function)\nprobability distribution\ndiscrete probability distribution\n\ncontinuous probability distribution\n\ncumulative distribution function (cdf)\n\nlikelihood\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nRubric S2: Basic probability theory notation and terms - 17/100 points\n\n\n\n\n\n\nQ3: \nHow is the answer?\n\nTotally wrong/has not tried\nSomething sensible written\n\nAll/almost all are correct (&gt;=70% correct)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n3 Basic computer skills\nThis task deals with elementary plotting and computing skills needed during the rest of the course. You can use either R or Python, although R is the recommended language and we will only guarantee support in R. For documentation in R, just type ?{function name here}.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSubtask 3.a)\n\n\n\n\n\nPlot the density function of the Beta-distribution, with mean \\(\\mu = 0.2\\) and variance \\(\\sigma^2=0.01\\).

The test is intended to be an initial screening test for the population in general. A positive result (presence of lung cancer) from the test would be followed up immediately with medication, surgery or more extensive and expensive test. The researchers know from their studies the following facts:\n\nTest gives a positive result in 98\\(\\%\\) of the time when the test subject has lung cancer.\nTest gives a negative result in 96 \\(\\%\\) of the time when the test subject does not have lung cancer.\nIn general population approximately one person in 1000 has lung cancer.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTask 4\n\n\n\n\n\nThe researchers are happy with these preliminary results (about 97\\(\\%\\) success rate), and wish to get the test to market as soon as possible. How would you advise them? Base your answer on Bayes’ rule computations.\n\n\n\n\n\nHint:\nRelatively high false negative (cancer doesn’t get detected) or high false positive (unnecessarily administer medication) rates are typically bad and undesirable in tests.\nHere are some probability values that can help you figure out if you copied the right conditional probabilities from the question.\n\nP(Test gives positive | Subject does not have lung cancer) = 4\\(\\%\\)\nP(Test gives positive and Subject has lung cancer) = 0.098\\(\\%\\) this is also referred to as the joint probability of test being positive and the subject having lung cancer.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nRubric S4: Bayes’ theorem 1 - 17/100 points\n\n\n\n\n\n\nQ10: \nIs p(has cancer|test result is positive) computed using Bayes’ formula (or its complement p(does not have cancer|test result is positive))?\nQ11: \nIs the result p(has cancer|test result is positive)=… (or p(does not have cancer|test result is positive)=…)\nQ12: \nIs the result motivated with something like …\n\n\n\n\n\n\n5 Bayes’ theorem 2\nWe have three boxes, A, B, and C.

After observing the color of the ball it is replaced in the box it came from. Suppose also that on average box A is selected 40% of the time and box B 10% of the time (i.e. \\(P(A) = 0.4\\)).\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSubtask 5.a)\n\n\n\n\n\nWhat is the probability of picking a red ball?

This is not the true value, see Exercise 1.6, page 28, in BDA3). American male singer-actor Elvis Presley (1935 – 1977) had a twin brother who died in birth. Assume that an equal number of boys and girls are born on average.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTask 6\n\n\n\n\n\nWhat is the probability that Elvis was an identical twin? Show the steps how you derived the equations to compute that probability and implement a function in R that computes the probability.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nRubric S6: Bayes’ theorem 3 - 17/100 points\n\n\n\n\n\n\nQ16: \nHow is the answer for probability of Elvis having had an identical twin brother?\n\nNo answer\nProbability that Elvis had an identical twin brother is computed using Bayes rule, but the result is not roughly …\nProbability that Elvis had an identical twin brother is computed using Bayes rule, and the result is roughly …\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n7 Overall quality of the report\n\n\n\n\n\n\nRubric S7: Overall quality of the report - 7.5/100 points\n\n\n\n\n\n\nQ17: \nDoes the report follow the formatting instructions?\n\nNot at all\nLittle\nMostly\nYes\n\nQ18: \nIn case the report doesn’t fully follow the formatting instructions, specify the formatting instruction that is not followed. If applicable, specify the page of the report, where this difference in formatting is visible.\nQ19: \nPlease provide also feedback on the presentation (e.g. text, layout, flow of the responses, figures, figure captions). Part of the course is practicing making data analysis reports. By providing feedback on the report presentation and other students can learn what they can improve or what they already did well. You should be able to provide constructive or positive feedback for all non-empty reports, even if there is nothing to say about the technical correctness of the answers. You can also provide feedback on code."
